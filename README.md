# Caterpillar Compact Track Loader – 3D Vehicle Modeling Using CATIA

## Project Overview
This project presents a mechanical modeling study of a **Caterpillar Compact Track Loader** developed using **CATIA** as part of the course **IPE 410 – CAD/CAM Sessional**. The objective was to create a precise 3D CAD model, emphasizing structured part design, assembly relationships, and realistic representation of a heavy construction machine.

## Course Details
- **Course Name:** IPE 410 – CAD/CAM Sessional  
- **Project Type:** Course Project / Academic Assignment  
- **Platform / Software:** CATIA  

## Key Features
- Individual components were designed with **accurate dimensions and mechanical connectivity**.  
- Assemblies were created using **constraint-based techniques** to ensure realistic interaction between parts.  
- An **exploded view animation** was generated to enhance visualization and understanding of the assembly.  
- Focus on skills in:
  - CATIA **Part Design**
  - CATIA **Assembly Design**
  - Mechanical system visualization  

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of **mechanical system modeling**.  
- Developed proficiency in **CATIA CAD software** for part and assembly design.  
- Learned to create **exploded views and animations** for clear design communication.
