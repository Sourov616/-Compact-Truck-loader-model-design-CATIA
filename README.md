# Advanced Mechanical Assembly Design (CATIA)

## Overview
This repository contains a complete mechanical design and assembly project developed using **CATIA**.  
The project focuses on parametric part modeling, kinematic assembly structure, and design for manufacturability.

All components and the final assembly were independently designed and modeled by me as part of my professional design portfolio.

## Objectives
- Develop detailed mechanical parts using parametric constraints  
- Build a functional multi-part assembly with proper relationships  
- Apply engineering design standards for accuracy and feasibility
